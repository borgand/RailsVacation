RailsVacation
=============

Vacation message editor on Rails for managing procmail-style vacation scripts.
RESTful authentication on (My)SQL user database.

Installing procmail and vacation script is left to user.

Each .procmailrc has to INCLUDERC the vacation.rc file that RailsVacations
is managing. If this is done, RailsVacation handles the rest:
 - setting up the files/dirs
 - changing vacation message
 - toggling the vacation state

Vacation script should accept '-a' option for aliasing these addresses (which
are generated from user database):
 - username
 - username@example.com
 - firstname.lastname@example.com
